## General Info
This website was create with purpose to review concepts about vue and figure out how works the framework.
I didn't use vue cli, because I would wanted build structure manually.

It's possible to simulation addition and remotion of items in shop cart.

## Technologies
Project is created with:

* HTML5
* JavaScript
* CSS3
* Vue.js v2.6.6
* local API

## Setup
To run this project in local is necessary has node.js and npm. Then you'll have to install live server: 

```
$ npm install -g live-server
```
Open the file and run live server:

```
